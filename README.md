# Reinforcement Q-Learning in Python

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most beautiful branches in Artificial Intelligence.
The objective of RL is to maximize the reward of an agent by taking a series of actions in response to a dynamic environment.
Q-learning is a values-based learning algorithm. Value based algorithms updates the value function based on an equation.
I explained the concepts of Q-learning and demonstrated how to implement it in Python.
